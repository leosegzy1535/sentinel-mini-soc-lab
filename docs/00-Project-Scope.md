# Project Scope

## Objective
To build a Mini-SOC using Microsoft Sentinel that demonstrates log ingestion,
security detection, incident investigation, threat hunting, and MITRE ATT&CK
mapping in a controlled home lab environment.

## In-Scope
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)
- Azure AD / Entra ID sign-in logs
- Simulated security incidents
- KQL-based detections and threat hunting
- Incident documentation and reporting

## Out of Scope
- Attacking real systems
- Scanning external networks
- Any illegal or unethical activity

## Success Criteria
- At least 3 analytic rules generating incidents
- At least 8 KQL threat hunting queries
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for each detection
- 2 documented incident investigations
