# Threat Hunting

This section will document threat hunting queries developed in Microsoft Sentinel
to identify suspicious authentication activity, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK
framework.

At this stage, data ingestion delays were observed due to tenant freshness.
Threat hunting queries will be designed using expected log schema and validated
once telemetry becomes available.
